# Customer 360 Architecture

## Product Vision

APForce is a performance platform for Angel One APs and sub-brokers. The CRM, WhatsApp inbox, and employee performance tracking used to be separate tools bolted together. Phase 2 unifies them around the single entity that matters most: the **Customer**.

A customer interacts with an AP through multiple channels (WhatsApp, forms, referrals), progresses through a sales pipeline, receives follow-ups, is targeted by campaigns, and eventually converts or churns. Every one of these events belongs to the customer — not to the channel, not to the campaign, not to the agent's task list.

The Customer 360 page is the single workspace where all of this is visible, actionable, and auditable in one place.

---

## Customer 360 Philosophy

### One entity, one page

There was previously a `/admin/crm/[id]` page (CRM Lead Detail) and a separate entry point via the WhatsApp Inbox sidebar. Both showed the same customer with different subsets of data. Agents had to switch between pages to get a complete picture. Phase 2 eliminates this split.

### Operational views remain separate

The Inbox is a queue manager — its job is to surface conversations that need attention. The CRM Pipeline is a stage manager — its job is to show where deals sit. These are workflows, not customer profiles. They remain separate navigation items. What changes is that clicking on a customer *name* from any of these views opens the same Customer 360 page.

### Everything connects from Contact

```
Contact
├── Conversations    → who said what, when
├── Timeline         → everything that happened, in order
├── CRM              → stage, pipeline position, deal value
├── Tasks            → follow-ups with outcomes
├── Notes            → internal agent notes
├── Documents        → shared files, WhatsApp media
├── Campaigns        → broadcast membership and send history
├── Automation       → which rules fire for this contact
└── AI               → health score, summary, next action
```

---

## Navigation Architecture

Three workflows reach the same destination:

```
WhatsApp Inbox  ──► [View Contact] button  ──┐
CRM Pipeline    ──► lead card click         ──┼──► /admin/contacts/[id]
Contact Hub     ──► row click               ──┘
```

See [NAVIGATION_ARCHITECTURE.md](NAVIGATION_ARCHITECTURE.md) for the complete flow map.

---

## URL Structure

```
/admin/contacts/[id]                      # default: Profile tab
/admin/contacts/[id]?tab=conversation
/admin/contacts/[id]?tab=timeline
/admin/contacts/[id]?tab=crm
/admin/contacts/[id]?tab=tasks
/admin/contacts/[id]?tab=notes
/admin/contacts/[id]?tab=documents
/admin/contacts/[id]?tab=campaigns
/admin/contacts/[id]?tab=automation
/admin/contacts/[id]?tab=ai
```

Tab state is in the URL. Browser back/forward navigates between tabs. Deep-links from other pages work.

---

## Header Layout

The header is always visible regardless of which tab is active. It is the identity anchor of the page.

### Header Sections

```

### Header Fields

| Field | Source | Editable | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Avatar | Initials from name | No | Colour derived from leadId hash |
| Name | `contact.name` | Yes — inline | Saves on blur |

| WhatsApp button | `contact.phone` | No | Opens WhatsApp web (or Conversation tab) |
| Email | `contact.email` | Yes — inline | |
| Assigned | `contact.assignedTo` | Yes — dropdown | |
| Stage | `contact.stage` | Yes — dropdown | Triggers stage-change automation |
| Priority | Derived from stage + follow-ups | No | 🔥 Hot / Warm / Cold |
| Last activity | Latest message timestamp | No | Relative |

| Journey bar | Inferred from contact state | Partially | See Journey Bar section |

---

## Customer Journey Bar

### Purpose

The journey bar provides a visual representation of where a customer is in their relationship with the AP. It is not a funnel (not all customers go through all steps). It is a timeline marker.

### Steps

```
Source → Conversation → Lead → Meeting → Proposal → Won → Retention → Referral
```

### Step Inference Rules

| Step | Complete when |
|---|---|
| Source | Always — contact exists |
| Conversation | `messageCount > 0` |
| Lead | Contact has a CRM stage entry |
| Meeting | `contact.milestones.meeting` is set (manual, future) |
| Proposal | `contact.stage === 'Proposal'` or past it |
| Won | `contact.stage === 'Won'` |
| Retention | `contact.milestones.retention` is set (future) |
| Referral | Relationship graph has referral link (future) |

### Visual States

- **Filled circle** — step is complete
- **Active ring** — current step
- **Hollow circle** — future step
- Hovering a step shows tooltip: date + actor (when available)

### v1 Behaviour

Steps 1–5 (Source through Proposal/Won) are inferred automatically. Steps 6–8 (Retention, Referral) display as hollow placeholders. Clicking any step in v1 does nothing (future: filters Timeline to that stage's events).

---

## AI Health Score

### Purpose

A single number (0–100) summarising how healthy the customer relationship is. Designed to surface at-risk contacts before they go cold.

### Six Factors (All Reserved in v1)

| Factor | Description | Future Source |
|---|---|---|
| Replies | How often the customer replies | `messageCount`, response rate |
| Engagement | Opens, reactions, clicks | Meta webhook read receipts |
| Follow-ups | Task completion rate | Follow-up done/total ratio |
| Inactivity | Days since last message | Last message timestamp |
| Sentiment | Tone of customer messages | AI sentiment analysis |
| Purchases | Conversion events | Won stage + external data |

### v1 Behaviour

The health score widget renders in the header and AI tab with a placeholder state. Until AI scoring is enabled for an account (feature flag), it shows `– / 100` in a muted style with no bar fill. The AI tab shows a banner: *"Health Score becomes active once AI is enabled for your account."* No fake data. No zeros that imply an unhealthy customer.

---

## Tab Specifications

### Tab 1 — Profile

Displays all static contact information. Read-mostly; fields are editable inline.

**Sections:**
- Personal Information (name, phone, email, city)
- Custom Fields (company, designation, annual income — configurable)
- Tags (add/remove, same component as Contact Hub)
- Source Tracking (created via, form, campaign, referral)
- Relationship Graph (placeholder — see Future Extensions)

### Tab 2 — Conversation

The canonical WhatsApp chat view for this contact, implemented as `ConversationTab` (`components/contacts/tabs/ConversationTab.tsx`).

**Implementation note (updated Commit 2):** `ChatPane` from the Inbox is architecturally coupled to `InboxContext`, which owns the full inbox state machine (all conversations, ping loop, unread counts). Mounting `InboxProvider` inside Customer 360 would duplicate the entire inbox API call surface — a clear violation of the "no duplicate API requests" rule. `ConversationTab` therefore reuses the same API endpoints, WebSocket subscription pattern, and UI conventions as `ChatPane`, but is fed by `Customer360Provider` instead of `InboxContext`.

**Behaviour:**
- `ConversationTab` reads messages, notes, and timeline from `Customer360Context` — no second fetch
- Message data comes from the same `/api/crm/leads/:id` call that hydrates the page (fetched once by `Customer360Provider`)
- WebSocket: subscribes to `whatsapp_message` events using `useWsEvent`; on match, calls `refresh()` which invalidates `['contact', leadId]`
- Reply-to threading, internal notes, canned responses (`/` shortcut) — all implemented
- Template picker reused directly from `components/whatsapp/TemplatePicker.tsx`
- Resolve / Reopen conversation — same API endpoints as Inbox
- Mark-read — same API endpoint as Inbox
- Optimistic send — same pattern as Inbox (cache update → mutate → settle)
- Media display (images, video, audio, documents) — implemented inline in `ConversationTab`
- Media upload (new attachments) — deferred to Commit 3; file picker shows informational toast
- Right activity panel slot reserved as `data-slot="activity-panel"` — hidden; future widgets plug in here
- `ConversationTab` is wrapped in `React.memo` to prevent rerenders when unrelated contact metadata changes

### Tab 3 — Timeline

A chronological activity feed covering everything that happened with this contact.

**Event types:**
- Inbound message
- Outbound message (with agent name)
- Internal note (agent name)
- Stage change (from → to, agent name)
- Agent assignment change
- Tag added / removed
- Follow-up created / completed (with outcome)
- Automation triggered (rule name)
- Campaign message sent

**Filters:** All, Messages, Notes, Stage Changes, Tasks, Campaigns, Automation

**Implementation note:** Timeline is synthesised client-side from data already fetched by other tabs. No dedicated timeline API endpoint is required in v1. A dedicated `/api/contacts/:id/timeline` endpoint is planned for v2 when event volume makes client-side synthesis impractical.

### Tab 4 — CRM

Pipeline position, deal details, and lead scoring for this contact.

**Sections:**
- Pipeline position bar (horizontal stepper showing all stages, current highlighted)
- Deal details (product interest, estimated value, close deadline, priority, source)
- Lead score (field-completeness score, 0–100, shows which fields are missing)
- CRM notes (free-text, separate from internal notes in Notes tab)

**Mutations:** Stage change, assign, tag management — same APIs as current CRM pages.

### Tab 5 — Tasks

All follow-ups for this contact, grouped by urgency.

**Groups:** Overdue → Today → Tomorrow → This Week → Later

**Mark Done flow:** Clicking "Mark Done" opens an inline outcome modal:
- What happened? (free text)
- Create next follow-up? (yes/no toggle, date picker if yes)

This captures outcome data currently lost when agents mark tasks done.

### Tab 6 — Notes

Internal agent notes — not visible to the customer, separate from chat messages.

**Behaviour:**
- Text input at the top, "Post" button
- Notes feed below, newest first
- Each note shows: agent name, timestamp, text, delete button
- Notes are not editable after posting (audit integrity)

### Tab 7 — Documents

WhatsApp media shared in the conversation, plus manually uploaded files.

**Sections:**
- Media grid: images and videos from messages with `mediaUrl`
- File list: PDFs, audio, uploaded documents (future S3 upload)

### Tab 8 — Campaigns

Broadcast membership and message send history for this contact.

**Sections:**
- Active campaign membership (which broadcasts include this contact)
- Send history: date, template name, delivery status (sent/delivered/read/failed)
- Action: "Add to campaign" button

### Tab 9 — Automation

Which automation rules are active for this contact and their execution history.

**Sections:**
- Active rules: rule name, trigger, last fired, status
- Run history: date, rule name, action taken, outcome

### Tab 10 — AI

AI-generated intelligence about this contact.

**Sections:**
- Health score gauge (0–100) with factor breakdown
- AI summary (natural language paragraph from `/api/ai/insights`)
- Recommended next action (call / send message / schedule follow-up)
- Sentiment history chart (positive/neutral/negative over time)

All sections show reserved placeholders until AI is enabled.

## Data Architecture

### Customer360Provider

Added in Commit 2. `Customer360Provider` (`contexts/Customer360Context.tsx`) is the single source of truth for all data on the Customer 360 page.

```
ContactDetailPage
  ErrorBoundary
    div.h-screen
      Navbar(showBack)
      div.flex-1
        Suspense(PageSkeleton)
          ContactDetailPageInner              ← useParams + useSearchParams
            Customer360Provider(leadId)       ← owns ['contact', leadId] + ['crm-pipeline']
              Customer360PageContent          ← reads from useCustomer360()
                ContactHeader(contact, stages)
                ContactTabNav
                div.flex-1.overflow-auto
                  ContactTabPanel(activeTab)
                    ProfileTab                ← reads contact from props
                    ConversationTab           ← reads from useCustomer360() + own lazy queries
                    [future tabs...]
```

**Rules:**
- All tabs call `useCustomer360()` to access shared data
- No tab may directly call `useQuery(['contact', leadId])` — they consume from context
- Tabs may add their own **lazy** queries (e.g. `ConversationTab` adds `['admin-employees']` and `['wa-canned']` only when mounted)
- `refresh()` from context invalidates `['contact', leadId]` — all tabs reflect the update automatically

## Component Hierarchy

See [UI_COMPONENT_ARCHITECTURE.md](UI_COMPONENT_ARCHITECTURE.md) for the full component tree with props and state ownership.

---

## Relationship Graph (Reserved)

The Profile tab contains a reserved section for the Relationship Graph. In v1, all fields display as `–` with a note that this feature is planned. The section headings and field slots are present in the DOM so they do not require a layout change when the feature ships.

Reserved relationship types:
- Company
- Decision Maker
- Influencer
- Referral From / Referred
- Family
- Accountant / Advisor

---

## Future Extensibility

The Customer 360 page is designed to absorb new tabs without structural changes. The tab nav is data-driven. Adding a new tab requires:
1. A new tab constant in the tab config array
2. A new `*Tab.tsx` component under `components/contacts/tabs/`
3. A case in the tab panel switch

See [FUTURE_EXTENSIONS.md](FUTURE_EXTENSIONS.md) for planned extensions.
